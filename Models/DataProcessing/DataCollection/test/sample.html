Fig. 2, is a profile elevation of the rightend of the loom. Fig. 3, shows thedriving parts of the loom on the left end. Fig. t, is a horizontal view o-f the cams and treadles, with the upper part ofthe&#39;loom removed. Fig. 5, is a sectional view of the figuring works, detached from the machine. Fig. 6, is a horizontal view, of they parts of the loom, forward of the shuttle boxes. Fig. 7 represents the stop motion. Fig. 8, is a side view of the pliers or forceps,with one standard removed. Fig. 9, is a front view of the apparatus to shift the wires, detached from the machine. Fig. l0, is a back view of the apparatus to push the wires toward the pliers or forceps. Fig. 11, represents the &#39;shuttle and bobbin. Fig. l2, represents the temples or cloth guides. </p>\n<p> The same letters refer to the same parts when they occur in any of the figures. </p>\n<p> a, a, a, a, are four upright posts, which are connected together, by horizontal rails b, b, b, Z). o, c, are two other upright posts resting on the cross rails 6,2). f, f, j, f, are cross horizontal rails for connecting the ends of the framework. </p>\n<p> The warp beam g, containing the linen or ground warp, and the warp beam t containing the worsted or that warp which is raised above the ground warp to conceal the weft, are mounted on axles turning in bearings attached to the framework. </p>\n<p> The bobbins z&#39; z&#39; z&#39; contain the figuring warp and are supported by the creelV y&#39;. From these beams and bobbins, the warp threads passover their respective whip-rollers 7c, Z, m, thence through the raddle a,;headles cordy passing around the warp-beam 7L, to </p>\n<p>The weights s, s, s, s, in they same manner Vpreserve the tension of the figuring warp. Y </p>\n<p>ing onthe stud of the ratchet wheel, a&#34;, with the clicks y, y, jointedy to itsv short arm. </p>\n<p>yThese clicks act on, and turn the ratchet wheel when the lever w, is moved; by the cam c. The pinion gear e on the&#39;side of the ratchet ywheel a takes into the teeth of the cogged wheel a&#39;, aiiixed to the axle of the cloth roller &#39;0.` b, b, are clicks playing on a stud attached to the post a, (being hid in the drawing behind the post a) which act onthe teeth of the ratchet wheel a, tosecure the lace that has been wound up, when the clicks 1 y, release their hold to act on other teeth. </p>\n<p> The pulley or rigger d receives its motion from the mill work, by the belt e and moves the loom when, the clutch ffeonnects it with the pinion gear gl. vThis pinion takes into the cogged wheel 7L aflixedtovthe main axle across the loom, and turns in the bearings j, j. This axle, by means of an endless screw, and`` cams or wipers-attached thereto, gives the principal motions of. allthe operations performed by the machine, The Viirst of these operations to be described, isthe giving outof the linenwarp as fastwasit is filled by the weft; second,that which raises and depresses thewarp, to receive the shuttle; third, regulating the variations in the `pattern or figure; fourth,.driving theshutf tle to and frogfifth, beating iupA the weft; sixth, shifting the wires `over which the ligure iswrought. V; </p>\n<p>z The axle a&#34; is arrangedv horizontallyy V0, 0, and p, p, andreed g, in the ordinary way. r 1s a weight suspended by a friction Y 60 keep thewarp ata proper degree of tension. </p>\n<p> The linen or ground warp,visgiven out asi follows: The worm or endlessscrew V7e, </p>\n<p>is aflixed tothe end of the shaft i&#39;, and takes into the teeth of the cogged wheel Z, on the end .of the axle m- To the reverse end of the axle m-,another worm or endless screw n, is affixed, which takes intothe `teethof the cogged wheel o, and revolvesthe cylinder p&#39;, on its axle in the bearings f&#34;, 1&#34;. The axle m&#39;, turns in bearings g&#39;, g&#39;, attached to the frame-work. </p>\n<p> The diameter of the cylinder 20&#39;, and the number of teeth of the cogged wheels Z&#39;, o&#39;, are so proportioned, as to move the disk or circumference of the cylinder p&#39;, at each throw of the shuttle, through a space equal to the length of the linen warp filled bythe thread of the weft, thus introduced. </p>\n<p>The upper extremities of the wires s&#39;, S&#39;, </p>\n<p>hook on to the ends of the axle of the warp; </p>\n<p>beam g, and are connected at their lowerextremities by the cross-bar t&#39;. The weight w&#39;, is suspended from the lever c&#39;, resting on the cross-bar t&#39;, and presses the warp on the warp beam g, against the disk of the cylinder thus causing the beam g to turn with the cylinder p&#39;, and deliver a certain length of warp at each revolution of the cylinder, however much the diameter of the warp around the beam may vary. </p>\n<p> The whip-roller Z over which the linen warp passes, turns in bearings in the arms r?, 1&#34;?, extending from the axle S7 which turns inthe bearings t7, t7. u2 is an arm extending from the axle s&#34;, from which the weight v7, is suspended; which weight serves to tighten the warp, and at the same time allow the whip-roller Z, to move forward and prev-ent too great tension of the warp when the heddles are raised to form the sheds. Y </p>\n<p>` VThe raising and depressing of the warp to receive the shuttle are effected as follows: The cams or wipers fw&#39;, w&#39;, W&#39;, are affixed tothe axle z&#34;, and act on the levers or treadles y&#39;, y&#39;, Y&#39;, which play on the fulcra X&#39;. The straps or cords s&#39;, a&#39;, Z&#39;, </p>\n<p>connect the treadles y, y&#39;, Y&#39;, to the armsv a2, a2, A2, Fig. 5, extending from the axles b2, b2, B2, which turn` in the bearings c2, 02, C2; cl2, d2, D2, are arms extending from the reverse sides of the axles b2, Z22, B2, from which the heddles 0, 0,0 are suspended by the cords e2, e2, E2. f2, f2, F2, are weights connected to the bottom of heddles o, 0, t). </p>\n<p> As the shaft z&#39;, revolves the eccentric parts of the camsV come around at proper intervals, and force down the treadles y&#39;, y&#39;, Y&#39;, which by means of the cords a&#39;, z&#39;, Z&#39;, turns the axles b2, Z22, B2, raises the heddles and forms the sheds of the warp. When the cams relieve their action on their respective treadles, the headles are again depressed by the weights f2, f2, F2. </p>\n<p> The two leaves of heddles o, o, are sufficient to weave laces with plain grounds, or fabrics, but in weaving those laces in which certain of the warp threads are overlaid, the third leaf O is required, which leaf being raised relatively at such distant intervals of time, require a graduatedv motion of the cam which moves it. This is effected as follows ,-the cogged&#39;wheel g2, Fig. 4, aiiixed to the axle z&#34;, takes into the teeth of the largest part of the pinion wheel, 71,2, which turns on the stud 2 attached to the frame-work. The teeth of the small part of the cogged pinion h2, takes into the teeth of the cogged wheel j2, affixed to the cam W&#39; which revolves loose on the shaft el&#39;. The number of teeth of these cogged wheels may be so calculated as to give different degrees of relative m0- Y tion to the cam WV&#39;, according to the number of threads of the weft, overlaid by the warp ;-thus when the warp overlays three threads of the weft, two revolutions of the axle z&#34; will be required to one of the cam. </p>\n<p> The third operation or that which regulates the variations in the pattern or ligure, is next described. Z2, Z2, are upright post or side-pieces (see Fig. which are connected together by the cross bars, or rails m2, n2, 02. When &#39;this part is connected with the main frame-work, the ends of the crossbars n2, 02, rest on the horizontal rails Z), Z), andy are bolted or otherwise affixed thereto. p2, p2, 792, are horizontal wires, sliding with a reciprocatory motion in holes through the plates of iron q2, r2, s2, which are screwed to the cross rails n2, 02.&#39; Between the plates of iron r2, s2, a spiral spring is encircled around each horizontal wire p2, 792, 292, one end of which is attached thereto by the pin 2, inserted Y in the wire, the other abuts against the plate of iron r2. This spring yields to any gentle pressure, made on that extremity projecting beyond the plate of iron s2, and returns again when that pressure is removed till the pin t2 strikes against the plate 82. Eyesv are formed in the central parts of these horizontal wires, through which the vertical wires u2, u2, pass. The wires a2, u2, are hooked at the upper extremity and arranged vertically over the lifting bar. In the lower extremities of the vertical wires, eyes are formed, to which the cords v2 v2 are attached. From these eyes the cords @2, @2, pass through the guide holes in the cross-pieces Q02, w2, to the heddles p, p, suspended therefrom. </p>\n<p> m2, m2, are weights attached to the heddles p, p, to depress them after they have been raised by the lifting-bar, and preserve their tension during the operation of the other parts of the loom. The lifting bar y2 has a vertical reciprocating motion in the guides r2, r2, which are attached to the sidepieces of the frame 152, t2. The wires a3, a2, connect the lifting bar y2, to the arms b3, b2&#39;, extending from the axle c3. </p>\n<p> (Z3, is the reverse arm of the axle 03, to which is attached the upper extremity of the cord e2, Fig. 2 which connects it with the treadle f3, Fig. 4:. The lifting-bar y2, Fig. 5 is` raised by the cam g2 acting on the treadle f2, Fig. 4L and when the cam relieves its action thereon, it falls again by its own gravity. </p>\n<p>It is `evident from what has been de those vertical wires and heddles o-nly, the horizontal wires of which have not beenV pushed back, and a corresponding variation&#39; will be produced in the pattern or figure. </p>\n<p> The apparatus to push back certain of the horizontal wires is thus described.y The cylinder h3, is mounted on an axle turning vin bearingsl in the frame Z3, which oscillates on the axis js. In the circumferenceY of this cylinder as many longitudinal rows of holes are formed, directlyopposite to&#39;the ends of the horizontal wires 2, p2, p2, as </p>\n<p>there are variations to be mace in the pattern or figure. </p>\n<p>The number and position of the holes in each row, are varied according to the variation to be made in the figure; that is, holes` are bored in any one of the rows, opposite to the ends of those horizontal wires only, which connect with the heddles required to be raised when the said row swings against the horizontal wires. </p>\n<p>The ratchet wheel 763 Fig. 2 .having as man e a r &#39;f t eth s there a e longitudinal rows ofholes in the cylinder k3, is attached to the axel of the said cylinder, and is acted on by the click Z3, which (being concealed in the drawing behind the horizontal rail b) is attached to the framework. m3 Fig. l, is another ratchet wheel, which has as many teeth and is afiixed to the axle like the former, and is acted on by the spring a3, attached to the frame 3 Fig. 5. </p>\n<p> The bars 03, 03, connect the frame t3, with the arms p3, p3, extending from the axle g. From the reverse side of this axle another arm r3, extends which is connected with the treadle s3, Fig. 4 by the cord t3, Fig. 2. a3, is a spring one extremity of which is attached to the arm r3, the other to the framework. v3 is a4 cam or wiper attached to the axle 1. This apparatus operates as follows: </p>\n<p> The cam o3 forces down the treadle s3, and turns the axle g3, which being connected with the frame 3, carries the cylinder away from the horizontal wires. </p>\n<p> As the cylinder is thus moved back, one tooth of the ratchet wheel 7c3, strikes against the click Z3, which overcomes the elastic force of the spring n3, and turns the cylinder on its axis the distance of one tooth of the ratchet wheel, or in other words, the distance between the centers of any two rows of holes in its circumference; at this instant the spring n3, takes into a new space &#39;of the&#39;ratchet wheel m3 and secures the cylinder in its proper position. </p>\n<p>e When the cam o3, relieves its action 011 the treadle s3, the spring a3, raises the arm r3, and forces the cylinder against the wires, and pushes back those which have no holes opposite to them in the cylinder, while, those wires which have corresponding holes in the cylinder, enter therein, and remain at rest, with thev hooked wires connected with them over the lifting-bar. </p>\n<p> The cylinder thus presenting a new row of holes, and swinging against the ends of thehorizontal wires, and pushing certain of the hooked wires, from the action of the lifting-bar every time it is raised, produces variations in the pattern,or figure corre&#39;- sponding with the variationsof the holes in its circumference. </p>\n<p> The fourth operation is that which drives the shuttle to,y and fro, and may be understood as follows-j The shuttle boxes rw3 w? Fig. 6 are affixed to the posts c, c, at a suitable distanceto allowthe rod to pass betweenthem; 0 0?, ma, are picker-rods; ya, ya, represent the shuttlebinders; s3, es, Fig. l are openings or mortices in the front side of the shuttle-&#34;boxes, to receive the guide wire of the shuttle.v </p>\n<p> The pickers a, a4, Fig. 6 slide on-the rods m3, 003, with their lower extremities playing in mortices b4, b4, in&#39;the bottom of the boxes; G4, 04, Fig. 2 are picker-strings connecting the pickers a4, a4, tothe pickerstaf d4, which is aflixed to the pulley e4, Fig. 1. This pulley turns on a stud attached to the cross-bar f4. Thestrap g4 passing over the pulley connects it to the treadle h4, 71,4. Z4, 4, are cam-bolts attached to the cams on the main axle Z1, and as they revolve with the said axle force down the treadle h4, h4, alternately, and by means of the strap g4, vibrates the picker-staff and throws the shuttle to and fro. </p>\n<p> The weft is beat upas follows .the lay is mounted on an axle turning in bearings jl, j* Fig. 2, attached to the framework; 724, 7a4, are the swords of the lag; Z4 is the top shell, which receives and supports the upper edge of the rod. f 115 The bars of iron m4, m4 are aiiixedto the top shell and extend downward `to the lower shell of the lay-n4, and supports the lower edge of the rod. 04 o4 are straps with one extremity of each attached to the top shell of the lag t, the other end of each to the framework. The upright arm p4, ex-v tending from the axle of the lag, is connected by the cord g4, to the lever r4, which is attached to the pulley s4. The pulley s4, is Y suspended between the posts a, by the cord 4, passing through the holes ut, ut, in the pulley, and the holes o4, o4, in the posts a, a. rIhe pulley is turned to twist the cord, which offers a degree of resistance in pro- 13u portion to the tension of the twist, andw serves to bring forward the lag to beat up the weft. The cord wt, attached to the lag, passes from them over the pulley g4, to the treadle g4. The cam a* on the main axle il, forces down the treadle g4, which by means of the Vcord wt, draws back the lag, and increases the tension Vof the cord t4, which cord, as the cam relieves its action on the treadle, throws the lag forward and beats up the weft. The degree of motion given to the lag by the cord t4 is determined Vby the straps of, 04. </p>\n<p> 7e now come to the sixth operation, or: that which shifts the wires over which the igure is wrought. I </p>\n<p> a5, is a frame similar in fornito an inverted T (see Fig. 10.) lwhich is mounted on an axis turning in the bearings b5, b5, Fig. 2. c5, Fig. 10 is a cam turning on the bearings b5, b5, Fig. 2. c5, Fig. l0 is a cam turning on the stud d5, affixed to the frame a5, with the studs e5, f5, extending from one of its sides. The stud g5, extending from the frame a5 determines the quantity of motion of the cam in the direction toward it. </p>\n<p> The spring h5 attached to the frame a5 always tends to move the cam toward the st-ud g5. The bar 5 is made flat and pointed at the upper extremity and has a vertical reciprocating motion in the guide j5 j5. The lever h5 has a groove at its upper extremity in that edge which presents toward the wires Z5, Z5, Z5, and turns on the fulcrum m5 attached to the frame a5. a5 represents the guide iron attached to the upper extremity of the frame a5. 05, Fig. 2 represents a spring inserted between the frame a5 and the breast beam u. This spring presses the guide iron 71,5 against the last of the series of wires Z5, Z5, Z5, Fig. 9, or that one which is to be acted on and thus keeps the frame a5 in the same position relative to the said wire, that is the one to be acted on, although the position of the succeeding wires themselves as Vthey successively approach this situation (being successively drawn out and placed under a new portion of the figuring warp) may at different times vary. </p>\n<p> A frame formed similar to a lay turns on an axis in the bearings p5, p5, Fig. 2,&#39;af1ixed to the posts a, a-g5 75 (see Fig. 9.) are the swords the to-ps of which rest against the frame v5. x5 is the cross rail to connect the swords together. An arm 85, Fig. 4c, is attached to this frame on which the cam t5 acts to move it. Fig. 5, a5, a5, represents o5 atached to the frame-work of the machine, on which the frame v5, slides with a horizontal reciprocating motion. Q05 is a spiral spring attached at one extremity to the frame o5 at t-he other to the breast beam u. </p>\n<p> The bar m5, Fig. A9, slides in the standard on the&#39;frame v5 with a transverse reciproeating motion. g5 represents a stop attached to the bar5, which determines the quantity of approach of the pliers toward the wires Z5, Z5, Z5. .e5 represents a piece of iron called the evener bolted to the bar m5. To the bar m5 the geared pliers are aflxed as represented in Fig. 8. 0:5, a6 are standards screwed or otherwise aifixed to the bar m5 (one of which is removed in this figure) which support the axis of the blades of the pliers b5 05. </p>\n<p> Teeth are formed on these blades at the point. of contact at their centers of motion which take into each other similar to the action of two cogged wheels, so that raising and depressing the long part of the blade b opens and closes the pliers. Z5 represents a spring, which is attached to the bar :v5 and tends to raise the long part of the blade b5 and open the pliers. The latch e vibrates on the stud f5 attached to the bar m5 and is acted on by the spring g5. The spiral spring 71,5, Fig. 6, is aiiixed at one extremity to the bar m5 at the other to the frame v5. 5, Fig. 9, represents an elbow playing on the stud f5 with its upright arm resting against a stud a5 extending from the bar m5. The </p>\n<p>-hook la attached to the upright part of the elbow, acts on the stud e5 and moves the cam 05. </p>\n<p> The wire Z5, connects the horizontal part of the elbow with the treadle m5 the projection of which is acted on by the cam fn, Fig. 4, aixed to the axle 1. The spring 05, Fig. 9, being attached at one extremity to the horizontal part of the elbow 5, at the other to the frame o5, serves to counteract the weights of the treadle m5. </p>\n<p> The latching wire p5, Fig. l, is hooked at the upper extremity and connected at its lower extremity to the treadle g5, Fig. 4, which is acted on by the cam ball z5 playing on the stud S5, attached to the cam uc. The standard t5, Fig. 9, attached to the o, &#39;a5 serves to release the latch e from the blade of the pliers b5. .v </p>\n<p> Considering&#39; the position which the pliers or pincers assume after having deposited a wire under the figuring warp and returned again to a line with the wire next to be taken by them and parallel with the breastbeam, as the point of commencement, we shall describe the movements of the machinery specified under this operation. </p>\n<p> The main axle l turning, the notch of the cam n.5 comes around and suffers the spring 05 to raise the treadle m5, and horizontal part of the elbow 5, which motion of the elbow carries its upright part away from the stud u and allows the spring ZL, Fig. 6, to move the pliers toward the wires Z5 Z5 until the stop g5 meets the standard of the frame (v5 and prevents its farther approach. As the upright part of the elbow is thus moved back the hook k, Fig. 9, acts on the stud e5 and moves the cam c5 toward the spring h5, Fig. </p>\n<p>les </p>\n<p>10. This movement of the cam raises the bar Z5 and forces the point of it between the last of the series of wires Z5 Z5 or that one against which the guide iron a5 rests and the one next in order from it, and separates one from the other and thus prevents more than one being acted upon at the same time. </p>\n<p> When the bar 5 has arrived at its greatest elevation the stud f5 strikes against the lower arm of the lever 755 and forces the grooved side of the reverse arm against the end of the wire Z5 operated as above described and forces it toward the pliers or Y forceps into the posit-ion seen in Fig. 9; at this instant the cam ball r, Fig. 4, acts on the treadle g5 and depresses the latching wire p5 which forces down the longer part of the blade b closes the jaws of the pliers or forceps and pinches the wire tight b e.- tween them. </p>\n<p> As the longer part of the blade 795 is thus depressed the shoulder of the latch c5 looks onto its extremity and secures the grasp of the pliers on the wire `after the action of the cam ball 1&#34;@ is released from the treadle m5 depresses the horizontal part of the elbow i and slides the bar mp5 in the standard of the frame v5, which movement of the bar draws out the wire grasped by the pliers, from under the figure wrought over it and moves them into the posit-ion seen in Fig. 6. This motion of the elbow 135 relieves the action of the hook 765 from the st-ud c5, Fig. 10, and allows the spring 715 to move the cam c5 back against the stud g5, which movement of the said cam suffers the bar 5 t-o fall and causes the stud f5 tomove the lever 705 into the positions in which they are respectively seen in Figs. 6 and 10-and in which they are prepared to act on the succeeding wires. At the proper interval the cam Z5, Fig. 4, acts on the arms S5 and slides the frame &#39;05, Fig. 6 on the 05 11,5 a5, and carries the pliers connected with the frame @5 back toward the suttle boxes to the properposition to place the wire under the figuring warp, at </p>\n<p>the instant they arriveat their destination another notch in the cam ne suffers the spring 05 to` carry the upright part of the elbow 5 away from the stud a5 which movement of the said elbow allows the spring h5, Fig. 6, to draw thepliers up and place the wire they grasp under the figuring warp; just as the pliers complete their mot-ion in this direction the vlatch 05 strikes against the` standard f which releases it from the blades 725 and suffers the spring (Z5 to open the jaws of the pliers and rdrop the wire. At this instant the cam n&#34;, Fig. 4, </p>\n<p>again acts on the treadle m5 and carries the pliers back a short distance to prevent their coming in contact with the wires Z5, Z5, Fig. 9, as they return toward the breast bream; when this part of the cam has completed its action, the notch of the cani Z5, Fig. 4 </p>\n<p>suffers the spring co5, Fig. 2, to draw the frame 05, Fig. 9, back to a line with the next wire to be acted on, or in other Words the position it assumed when we began to describe the operation. When the wires drop from the pliers they are not all in the same position-that is some are placed under the figuring warp farther than others, therefore to even them and prevent any failure in the operation of shifting them, Which might occur from their irregularity, the evener e5, as the pliers approach the warp to deposit the wire, strikes against the wire last deposited and drives it in as far as it is suffered to do, by the motion of the&#39;bar m5; the wire deposited by this operation of&#39; the pliers, isdriven in, inthe same manner as the other-when the pliers come up to place in the next succeeding wire; all the wires being thus driven are left in anuniform Position. </p>\n<p> I do not deem it necessary to recapitulate the movements of this; machine in their order of succession, as this will be apparent to every competent machinist, and the periods of the different parts of the process being nearly the same as in ordinarycoachlace lboms. The pliers are armed with a wire While the weft is Vbeing inserted between the warp, and are prepared to move back simultaneously with the lay at the proper interval and place it under the figuring warp. v </p>\n<p> Thel rest c6, Fig. 6, is attached tothe breast beam and arranged over the lace, to preventthe lace back of the breast-beam from rising up and thus carrying thewires Z5, Z5, away from the pliers when thewarp is raised to form the sheds. &#39;L05 represents the standard of the temples (see Fig. 12) which ,is screwed to the inside of the breastbeam and under the cloth. we, m5, are the guides of the temples which are fastened to the stand we by the screw g5 @/5. The cloth passes between the guides a5 Q05 and is thus&#39; prevented from yielding when the wires Z5 Z5 are drawn out or pushed in. j </p>\n<p> Theloom is putin motion and thrown out of gea-r as follows: The lever a5, Fig. 1, turns on the stud a7 .and connects theclutch f7 with the shifting bar 777 which slides in the guides c7, c7, Fig. 1. The dotted lines at xl7, Fig. 7, represent a springembedded-in the bar 727. The spiral spring e7 is attached at one extremity Vto the bar 727 at the other i to the breast-beam u. The lever f7 turns on the stud 87 Fig. 6, attached to the breast-V beam. 717, Fig. 2, isa latch which vibrates on a stud-attached to the p ost a, and has a handle at its upper extremity which thev weaver grasps to stop the loom. The spring .7&#39;7, Fig. 7 being attached atl one end to the latch 71,7 atthe other to the breast-beam always tends to bring the-latch k7 toward `the lever f7. </p>\n<p>1ct f To put the loom in motion the weaver grasps the handle 7:7 and moves the bar 57 toward the right which movement of the bar moves the clutch f Fig. 4; and connects the coggeo wheel g with the pulley a at this instant the spring Z7 locks on the depending arm of the lever f7 and secures the connection. </p>\n<p>To stop the loom the weaver releases the clutch k7 and suffers the spring 07 Fig. 6 to. </p>\n<p>move the bar 57 and throw the loom out of gear. In the event of the weft being exhausted, on the bobbin in the shuttle, and also in case the shuttle does not arrive at. its destination, it is desirable that the loom should be thrown out of gear, to prevent an imperfect place being made in the lace.- Stopping the loom when the shuttle stops in its passage to and fro is effected as follows The protecting rod Z7 Fig. 6 turns in the bearings on the o5 a5, a5, and has the arms m7 m7, extending from it, the upper extremities of which rest against the shuttle binders g3, Q 3, Fig. 1.-# represents a spring which acts on the arm m7 and urges both the arms m7, m7, against their respective binders ys, &#39;g3,-07, Fig. 2, is the reverse arm extending from the rod Z7 and supports the bar p7, which connects with the latch 71.7 by means of an elbow and connecting rod which are hid in the drawing under the breast-beam. </p>\n<p> lhen the shuttle enters the box properly it pushes out the binder 3/3 and depresses the bar p7 and causes it to escape the lower shell of the lay as it comes forward to beat up the weft: but in the event the shuttle does not enter the box the spring a7 raises the bar p7 to meet the lower shell of the lay which as it comes forward strikes against the end of it and releases the latch L7 and suffers the spring e7 to throw the loom out of gear. </p>\n<p> Stopping the loom when the weft is exhausted may be understood&#39; as follows; 4.07 Fig. l1 represents the shuttle armed with the bobbin x7 containing the .wefty7 is a. spring affixed to the front side of the shuttle and is connected tothe binder e7 by the wire as which has a screw with the nut 198 to adjust the degree of resistance offered to the bobbin by the binder z7.-68 is the guide wire which guides. the weft o of the bobbin m7.-cZ8 is the stop wire sliding in holes through the guide wire GS and the stand 68.-f8 is a spiral spring encircled around the stop wire ZS one end of which is attached to the wire als by the vpin 88 inserted therein, the other abuts against the shuttle wood-This spring yields to any gentle pressure on the end of the wire projecting beyond the guide wire 08 and returns as far as suffered by the pin g8 .when that pressure is removed-Jl.S is a catch, which when the stop wire (ZS is pushed back even Vwith the outside of the guide wire 08 locks into a notch in the stop wire, and prevents its returning by the action of the spring f8 until the said catch is again released. </p>\n<p> The lever is Fig. 6 turns on a stud attached to the breast-beam u, and extends along the side of the latch 71.7 nearly to touch the shuttle guide.-\\7Vhen the stop wire Z8 is in the position seen in Fig. 11, the shuttle will pass to and fro without acting on the lever s and no effect is produced on the stop motion.#But when the filling is nearly exhausted on the bobbin the spring 7&#39;8 reciedes from the center as seen in the bobbin 7GB and as it comes around releases the catch LS and suffers the spring f8 to throw forward the wire als, which as the shuttle enters the left hand shuttle box strikes against the extremity of the lever s releases the latch 71,7 and suffers the spring e7 to throw the loom out of gear. </p>\n<p> Contemplated variations in the arrangements of the parts to shift the wires over which the ligure is wrought. The lever c Fig. 10, which pushes the wires toward the pliers may be dispensed with, in which event the upright part of the frame a5 must be removed to the reverse edge of the lace, and the bar i5 pass between those ends of the wires which the pliers grasp to shift them, and the guide iron n.5 must also rest against the said ends, presented to the pliers or forceps. </p>\n<p> The standards which support the reciprocating bar x5, instead of being stationary with the frame o5 may be affixed to an axle and vibrate in bearings, attached to the frame @5.-Tlie Vframe formed by the said axle and standards should be prevented from falling from the perpendicular toward the shuttle boxes, by a stop attached to the bearings,A in which the axle turns or to the frame v5 which supports the said bearings. A spring is affixed to the frame o5 which acts on the frame formed by the said axle and standards always tends to keep the Said frame in a perpendicular position and against the aforesaid stop. A guide iron is aixed to the said frame, which guide iron when the pliers approach the wires to grasp them glide along the side of another guide attached to the frame a5 and guides the pliers into the right position to take the last of the series of wires without acting on the one next in order to it. </p>\n<p> Many parts of machinery have been described above without any intention of claiming them las a new invention, but merely for the purpose of leading to and more readily illustrating the design and operation of my improvements. </p>\n<p> Having described my improvements in a loom to weave coach-lace, and shown by the foregoing description accompanying drawings, and model, the best mode of constructing and adapting the same that I am acquainted with; I desire to be understood that I do not intend to confine myself to that particular form, and arrangement and materials of the parts shown in the drawings and model by which I effect my improvements in looms to weave coach-lace; as different forms and arrangements of mechanism may be found capable of effecting the same objectg&#39;but those which I claim as the peculiar features of my invention are separatelyv and singly as follows l. Dividing or separating the wires&#39;over which the figure is wro-ught, one from the other, by means of a pointed instrument passing between them. </p>\n<p> 2. Pushing the&#39;said figuring wires successively toward the pliers, forceps, or pincers by the means of pressure exerted on the reverse ends `from those at which they are grasped by the pliers, forceps or pincers. </p>\n<p>3. Withdrawing the said figuring wires from the figure wrought over them, and Y placing them under a new portion of the figuring warp by means of pliers, forceps or pincers. </p>\n<p>4:. A guide resting against the last of the series of wires to preserve the machineryk which acts thereon in the same position relative to the said last of the series of wires. </p>\n<p>5. Moving the machinery employed to shift the said figuring wires by means ofy set my hand this twenty-seventh day 0f 40 December, in the year eighteen hundred and thirty-six. i </p>\n<p> ERASTUS B.

E. SELLERS, OF PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA. </p>\n<p>IMPROVEMENT IN CONCENTRATING-FURNACES FOR SIVIELTING IRON ORES BY THE USE 0F ANTHRACITE COAL IN WHICH OTHER KINDS OF FUEL CAN BE USED&#39;. </p>\n<p>Specilication forming part of Letters Patent No. E70, dated April 20, 1837. </p>\n<p>To LZZ whom it nfl/ty concern,.- </p>\n<p> Be it known that I, GEORGE EscoL SELLERS, of the city of Philadelphia and State of Pennsylvania, have invented an Improved Concentrating-Furnace for the Smelting of Iron Ores by the Use of Anthracite Coal, and in which coke or any of the other kinds of fuel applicable to the purpose of smelting may be advantageously employed; and I do hereby declare that the followingis a full and exact description thereof, reference being had to the drawing which accompanies and makes a part of this specication. </p>\n<p> To show the arrangement of the interior of the furnace averti cal and longitudinal section of it is given in the drawing. </p>\n<p> A is the main furnace for the reception of coal, which is to be supplied to it by&#39;means of the feeder B or any analogous contrivance. </p>\n<p>-This feeder resembles a ratchet-wheel in its transverse section. As shown in the drawing, it is placed and revolves within a curved casing under the hopper @,which is to be kept filled with coal. The outer points of Bshould be made to lit as closely as practicable to the cylindrical casing D D to prevent the escape of the heated air within the furnace. &#39;Beside this, there are other kinds of feeders well known to machinists,which will answer the purpose equally well. </p>\n<p> E is the tuyere through which the blast is to be supplied. The dotted line F shows&#39;the situation of the door for drawing off the slag; and I intend in general to use two doors directly opposite to each other, which, when opened&#39;, will allow the slag to be forced from the opera-tor, enabling him to discharge it in a ready manner. These doors must&#39; be constructed of that kind of red&#39; sandstone which is well known to iron-masters as best adapted to such purposes, or of some other good fireproof material. </p>\n<p> G is the chamber which is to receive the ore intended to be smelted, and is supplied by means of a feeder at I-I, which may be like that employed over the main furnace. </p>\n<p> I is the main flue or chimney by which the products of combustion are discharged into The melted metal flows from the smelting-ehamber into the receiving-bed J, the dotted lines K showing the door for the purpose of lading it out or for removing it in the form of loups or balls, according to circumstances. There may also be a tamphole at or near the bottom ofthe bed J for drawing 0H the metal when it is to be cast into pigs or otherwise. A suitable opening is also to be made for removing the slag of the ore. </p>\n<p> L is a small ue through which the dame and heated air will rush and heat the ore preparatory to its being completely melted at the lower part, M, of the chamber G. This flue determines also vthe height to which the coal in the main furnace A shall be ignited, by which it is prepared to supply the vacancy made by the blast or by the clearing out of the slag or cinder by the door F. Any intervruption of the process from these causes is thus obviated. </p>\n<p> Theflue N,Idenominate thel concentratingflue,77 and through this the main part of the blast from the tuyere will pass. It must rise at such an angle as to produce at the point M the full degree of heat required for the complete fusion of the ore. This is a point which must be left to judgment and experience, as it will vary with the force of the blast, the quality of the fuel, and the kind of ore to be smelted. It may be found best in some cases to cause the concentrating-flue towiden as it approaches the point M, while in others it may be diminished there so as to have a comparatively narrow aperture. The length of this flue, or, in other words, the distance between the main furnace A and the point M, it will undoubtedly be found best to vary from the same varying circumstances. From this cause I do not pretend to give any precise measurement or scale of parts, but have so proportioned the draW- ing as to furnish what I esteem a good general relative form, proportion, and arrangement. I intend sometimes to construct my furnace with out the main flue or chimney I, in which case the chamberG will perform its office, there being no feeder upon it, but the ore being thrownin at its opentop, or should itbe found advantageous, to raise this through an opening in the side of it. I also intend,in some cases, </p>\n<p>to construct aflue or dues, J J J, leading from the upper part of the chamber G into the chimney I, for the purpose of allowing the heated air to escape into the chimney at such height as experience may show to be best for completing the carbonization of the iron in G. </p>\n<p>&#39; In all the flues mentioned I of course employ such dampers as may be deemed necessary for their regulation. </p>\n<p> It is not necessary to sayanything upon thev subject of the mixture to&#39;be used with4 the ores for the purpose of iiuxing them, as there is not anything different from the usual procedure in this respect when my furnace is employed; but as the carbonization of the iron is a matter of vital importance in the process of smelting, I will here observe that the extent to which the carbonization .is to be carried will determine the proportionate quantity of anthracitecoal dust or ofthe dust of charcoal or coke, which must be mixed with the ore in the receiver. When, for example, soft pig metal is to be produced, the quantity mixed must be proportionately large; but when bariron is to be made, the quantity must be proportionably less, such quantity only being used as may be requisite for the separation of the scoria or cinder. Upon this point it is not possible to speak otherwise than Ain general terms, as with every different kind of ore experience will show that the dose must be varied in order to produce the best results. </p>\n<p> Having thus fully described the manner in which I construct my furnace, I do hereby declare that I do not intend to claim any of the parts so described in their individual characters. There is nothing new, for example, in the mode of feeding adopted by me, or in the principle of passing the blast through a stack containing fuel only and causing the flame and heated air therefrom to entera second chamber containing the ore to be smelted, this having been previously proposed and essayed; but </p>\n<p>Vhat I do claim is- I. That particular arrangement of the respective parts of the within-described furnace by which it may be distinguished. from all those that have preceded it, intending by this particular arrangement the manner of connecting the main furnace for fuel With that containing the ore to be reduced by a concentratingflue within which is contained, areceiving-bed for the reduced metalconstructed and operating in the manner herein set forth, combining the same with the smaller iiue, (marked L in the drawing,) for the purpose herein fully shown. </p>\n<p> 2. The provision for removing the slag from under the fuel in the main furnaceA by means of one or two openings constructed for that purpose, upon the principle or in the manner described. </p>\n<p> And I do further declare that I do not intend to limit myself by anything which I have herein said, or by the arrangement exhibited in the drawing, to any peculiar shape or proportion of the respective parts, but to vary these as may be found convenient in practice, while 1 attain the end proposed by means substuntially the same. </p>\n<p>GEO.
